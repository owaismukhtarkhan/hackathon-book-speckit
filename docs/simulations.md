# Simulation Environments

This section covers the simulation environments used throughout the book to practice robotics concepts without physical hardware.

## Gazebo

Gazebo is a 3D simulation environment for autonomous robots. It provides realistic physics simulation and rendering capabilities.

### Getting Started with Gazebo

1. Install Gazebo according to your operating system requirements
2. Set up your robot model in URDF format
3. Create simulation worlds
4. Test your robot's behavior in various scenarios

## Unity

Unity is a powerful game engine that can be used for high-fidelity robot simulation and visualization.

### Getting Started with Unity

1. Install Unity Hub and a compatible Unity version
2. Import the robotics packages
3. Create your robot models and environments
4. Implement robot control logic

## NVIDIA Isaac Sim

Isaac Sim is NVIDIA's robotics simulator with photorealistic rendering and synthetic data generation capabilities.

### Getting Started with Isaac Sim

1. Install Isaac Sim following NVIDIA's requirements (RTX GPU required)
2. Set up your robot models
3. Create synthetic data generation scenarios
4. Train your AI models using synthetic data

## Simulation Best Practices

- Always validate simulation results with physical testing when possible
- Understand the limitations of simulation vs. real-world physics
- Use simulation for rapid prototyping and testing
- Design experiments that can transfer from simulation to reality
