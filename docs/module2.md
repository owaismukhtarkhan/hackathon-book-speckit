# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

## Overview

This module covers simulation environments that serve as "digital twins" for robots, allowing you to test and develop robot behaviors in virtual environments before deploying to real hardware.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:
- Understand the importance of simulation in robotics
- Set up basic simulations in Gazebo
- Work with Unity for robot visualization
- Connect simulation environments to ROS 2

## Topics Covered

1. [Introduction to Robot Simulation](#introduction-to-robot-simulation)
2. [Gazebo Simulation Environment](#gazebo-simulation-environment)
3. [Unity for Robot Visualization](#unity-for-robot-visualization)
4. [Connecting Simulation to ROS 2](#connecting-simulation-to-ros-2)

## Introduction to Robot Simulation

Robot simulation is crucial for:
- Testing robot behaviors safely
- Prototyping without hardware
- Generating training data for AI systems
- Debugging complex behaviors

## Hands-on Exercise: Setting up a Simple Robot in Simulation
