# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book! This book is designed for absolute beginners who want to learn about AI systems that operate in the physical world, emphasizing Embodied Intelligence.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI refers to AI systems that understand physics, perception, motion, and interaction rather than existing purely in digital environments. This is the foundation of robotics and embodied intelligence.

## What will you learn?

In this book, you will:

- Design Physical AI systems
- Simulate humanoid robots
- Deploy AI-driven robotic behavior
- Integrate perception, planning, and action pipelines
- Work with ROS 2 (Robot Operating System)
- Use simulation environments like Gazebo and Unity
- Explore NVIDIA Isaac platforms
- Build Vision-Language-Action (VLA) pipelines

## Course Structure

The book is organized into modules that progressively build your knowledge:

- **Module 1**: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
- **Module 2**: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
- **Module 3**: The AI–Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)
- **Module 4**: Vision–Language–Action (VLA)

Let's begin your journey into the world of Physical AI!
